This\n            opportunity allowed me discover my passion for helping people uncover their\n            inner strengths, be more aware of themselves, and experience the magical\n            results of their journey.</p>\n            <p>I opened my private practice in\n            Atlanta. I counseled a diverse group of individuals and couples with multiple\n            issues, anxiety, depression, trauma, and identity. In the same period, I helped\n            create the Hispanic Mental Health unit for Positive Impact, Inc. This unit\n            provided individual, couples and family counseling to clients diagnosed with\n            HIV/AIDS.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            In Atlanta I worked as a Crisis\n            Management Consultant assisting clients in distress after a traumatic\n            experience via telephone assisting clients countrywide. I had the opportunity\n            to travel to New York twice after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack to\n            counsel and debrief traumatized and grieving survivors.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            In 2004, I became a Certified Imago\n            Relationship Therapist. This training allowed me to counsel couples more\n            effectively. I also had the opportunity to move to La Paz, Bolivia and opened\n            my practice practice. I also counseled inmates at a Women’s jail in La Paz as a\n            volunteer.\n            </p>\n            <p>Since 2007, I have lived in Northern Virginia first working part-time\n            at the Whitman Walker Clinic and since 2009 I have maintained a private practice.\n            Currently I only work via tele-health.\n            </p>\n            <p>In the past ten years, I have strengthened my ability to work\n            with clients who have experienced trauma through training in EMDR, Sensorimotor\n            Therapy and internal family systems.\n            </p>          \n          </section>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Generic\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
